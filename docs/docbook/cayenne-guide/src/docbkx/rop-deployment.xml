        <note><para>Recent versions of Tomcat and Jetty containers (e.g. Tomcat 6 and 7, Jetty 8) contain code
                addressing a security concern related to "session fixation problem" by resetting the
                existing session ID of any request that requires BASIC authentcaition. If ROP
                service is protected with declarative security (see the ROP tutorial and the
                following chapters on security), this feature prevents the ROP client from attaching
                to its session, resulting in MissingSessionExceptions. To solve that you will need
                to either switch to an alternative security mechanism, or disable "session fixation
                problem" protections of the container. E.g. the later can be achieved in Tomcat 7 by
                adding the following <emphasis>context.xml</emphasis> file to the webapp's META-INF/
                directory:
                <programlisting>&lt;Context>
    &lt;Valve className="org.apache.catalina.authenticator.BasicAuthenticator"
            changeSessionIdOnAuthentication="false" />
&lt;/Context></programlisting>(The
                &lt;Valve> tag can also be placed within the &lt;Context> in any other locations
                used by Tomcat to load context configurations)</para></note>
