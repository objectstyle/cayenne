<section xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="namedquery">
            <title>NamedQuery</title>
        <para>NamedQuery is a query that is a reference to another query stored in the DataMap. The
            actual stored query can be SelectQuery, SQLTemplate, EJBQLQuery, etc. It doesn't matter
            - the API for calling them is the same - via a
            NamedQuery:<programlisting language="java">String[] keys = new String[] {"loginid", "password"};
Object[] values = new String[] {"joe", "secret"};

NamedQuery query = new NamedQuery("Login", keys, values);

List&lt;User> matchingUsers = context.performQuery(query); </programlisting>
            <warning>
                <para>This query is deprecated in favor of <code>MappedSelect</code> and <code>MappedExec</code></para>
            </warning>
        </para>
