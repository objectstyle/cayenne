    <para>
        In databases relations are defined via foreign keys and there are a lot of different politics according to the level of relationships and 
        ways how those relationships could be modeled in database. Anyway, cdbimport is able to recognize basic patterns of relationships, such as
        OneToMany, OneToOne and ManyToMany. 
    </para>
    <section xml:id="skip-relationships-loading">
        <title>Skip Relationships Loading</title>
        <para>
            You are able to skip relationships loading by the <code language="xml">&lt;skipRelationshipsLoading&gt;</code> element.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="xml">
    &lt;dbimport&gt;
        &lt;skipRelationshipsLoading&gt;true&lt;/skipRelationshipsLoading&gt;
    &lt;/dbimport&gt;</programlisting>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="skip-pk-loading">
        <title>Skip Primary Keys Loading</title>
        <para>
            Another useful Cayenne reverse engineering property is <code language="xml">&lt;skipPrimaryKeyLoading&gt;</code>. If you decide to support all relationships at the application layer
            and avoid their management in database, youâ€™ll find useful to turn off primary keys synchronization at all.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="xml">
    &lt;dbimport&gt;
        &lt;skipPrimaryKeyLoading&gt;true&lt;/skipPrimaryKeyLoading&gt;
    &lt;/dbimport&gt;</programlisting>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Table Types</title>
        <para>By default, cdbimport imports tables and views. Some databases may support other
            table-like objects, e.g. <code>SYSTEM TABLE, GLOBAL TEMPORARY, LOCAL TEMPORARY, ALIAS,
                SYNONYM</code>, etc. To control which types should be included <code language="xml"
                >&lt;tableType&gt;&lt;/tableType&gt;</code> element is used. Some examples:</para>
        <para> Import tables only (skip views and others and other
            types):<programlisting language="xml">
    &lt;dbimport&gt;
        &lt;tableType&gt;TABLE&lt;/tableType&gt;
    &lt;/dbimport&gt;</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para> Tables and views (<emphasis>the default
            option</emphasis>):<programlisting language="xml">
    &lt;dbimport&gt;
        &lt;tableType&gt;TABLE&lt;/tableType&gt;
        &lt;tableType&gt;VIEWS&lt;/tableType&gt;
    &lt;/dbimport&gt;</programlisting></para>
